# Project Title
Predict Clicked Ads Customer Classification by Using Machine Learning

# Project Overview

The purpose of this project is creating the machine learning model that could classify whether the customer will clicked on Ad or not. With this classification model, the accuracy is expected to be increased and the company profitabiity will be increased.  <br>

Here are several question that need to be answered for the project completion: <br>
- Task 1: Analyze the data distribution and correlation between feature by using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. <br>
- Task 2: Preprocess the data by performing data cleaning, feature encoding, split target from feature, and extract the time column. <br>
- Task 3: Create two experiment with several machine learning model, one with data normalization, and the other without data normalization. Then, evaluate it with confusion matrix. <br>
- Task 4: Give business recommendation based on feature importance and simulate the business metric that compare the result with and without ML model. <br>
