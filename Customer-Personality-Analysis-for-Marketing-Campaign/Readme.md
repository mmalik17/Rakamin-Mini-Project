# Project Overview

The purpose of this project is creating machine learning model that could predict which customer that should be targetted in marketing campaign and which customer that should be ignored. The feature for this model is customer personality  

Here are several question that need to be answered for the project completion:

- Task 1: Create a plot that shows the relationship between the conversion rate and the users age category that have the most potential to respond to the campaign
- Task 2: Pre-process the data by handling null and duplicated value, drop the unnecessary data, feature encoding, and feature standardization
- Task 3: Create model for clustering the customer using K-Means and evaluate it with elbow method and silhouette score
- Task 4: Choose the cluster for campaign re-targetting and calculate the potential business impact after retargetting
